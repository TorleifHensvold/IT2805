	0.1 + 0.2 === 0.3 is false because floating point math. Basically the precision of floating point math in ECMAScript
	has slight errors, and when added together the errors might add up to just enough to let ECMAScript interpret it as
	a number slightly higher or lower than what would be expected. The same errors does not add up to enough to change
	the equivalency when the numbers are 0.2 + 0.2 === 0.4, as per the following link.

	The method attribute on a form element decides how the form is transmitted to the server. GET for stuff one
	might want to bookmark or general search terms, POST for secure data, or when you don't have a good reason to
	use GET.

3.
	The form fields appear in the URL when the method on form element is changed to GET because it then requests a page
	from the webserver with those fields instead of sending the data to the webserver without specifically requesting
	a new page. It is also less privacy-minded, as the URL can be looked at more easily than an encrypted blob being
	POST'ed

4.
	It is considered bad practice to only validate form input with HTML5 or JS because the user has total control over
	them and can change them on their end. Thus they can send you data you didn't expect either way, which can take
	control of your webserver if no validation and sanitation is performed on the server.

5.
	When you need the user to write something substantial, like several paragraphs, you use textarea, as that allows
	for multi-line input, while input only allows one line.
